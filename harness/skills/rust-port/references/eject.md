# Ejecting the rust-port harness into the port repo

`/harness:rust-port` runs in place; eject it for a git-tracked, repo-owned instance in the repo that
will hold the Rust port (recommended for a long, resumable port).

```bash
bash <plugin>/skills/rust-port/scripts/eject.sh <target-repo-dir>
```

SAFE (copy + scaffold only). It copies the orchestrator skill (`rust-port/`) and sub-skills
(`rust-port-inventory`, `rust-port-translate`, `rust-port-parity`, `session-relay`,
`cross-repo-health`) into `<target>/.claude/skills/`, the 6 agents into `<target>/.claude/agents/`,
scaffolds `<target>/.handoff/loop/`, and prints the `.gitignore` / `CLAUDE.md` snippets to apply.

After ejecting, invoke as **`/rust-port`** in the target repo. Seed `loop_state.md` with the **source
root** (project being ported) and the **Rust target** crate/dir on first run.

## Source vs target layout

The source project and the Rust target may be the same repo (port-in-place under a new crate) or two
repos. Record both paths in `loop_state.md`; the parity-verifier needs to *run the source*, so the
source's toolchain (bun/node/python) must be available in the port environment.
