# the real references/state-contract.md (so the doc can't silently drift from the gate):
#   * targets.md rows: status marker + lowercase-kebab slug + "scope" present
#   * graph artifact names: graph/<T>.{symbols,callgraph,metrics}.json + .{graph,diff}.md
#   * JSON validity of a synthetic symbols.json via jq (SKIPPED with a note if jq is absent)
#   * the documented examples parse under the very same validators
#
# Self-contained: no external script under test, no network, tmpdir for fixtures.
