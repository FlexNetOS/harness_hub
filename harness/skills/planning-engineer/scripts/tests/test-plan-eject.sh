# semantics when installing into a target repo's .claude/:
#   * OWN skills+agents are ALWAYS (re)copied (a re-eject refreshes them — sentinel is wiped)
#   * SHARED infra present in the target is NEVER clobbered (a target's canonical version survives)
#   * SHARED infra ABSENT in the target IS copied in (only if the hub plugin actually carries it)
#   * the .handoff/loop/plan/{graph,research,findings,reports} scaffold is created
#   * a nonexistent target dir is rejected (non-zero exit)
