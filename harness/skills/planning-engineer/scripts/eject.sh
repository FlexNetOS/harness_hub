# CLAUDE.md pointer:
## Harness: Planning Engineer
**Goal:** continuous, evidence-backed planning/architecture — code graph + 90-day research ->
adversarially-verified gaps -> a plan with ASCII diagrams, quality/speed/accuracy/governance+settings+config upgrades, tool-eval.
**Trigger:** for "plan <subsystem> / architecture plan / deep planning / loop on the architecture /
resume the planning loop", use the `plan-loop` (continuous) / `planning-engineer` (single-cycle) skill.
Read-only on production code; writes plans/graph under .handoff/loop/plan/ + docs.

# Harness self-tests (optional CI gate): the package ships hermetic, network-free tests at
#   .claude/skills/planning-engineer/scripts/tests/test-plan-{eject,loop-state,contract}.sh
# They resolve their scripts-under-test from the repo root; wire them into CI (run each with `bash`).
# The loop-state test needs ci/gates/loop-state.sh present (copy it if your repo runs the plan loop).
#
# Runtime gate/dispatch helpers (copy to the target's repo-root scripts/ if your repo runs the loop):
#   cp .claude/skills/planning-engineer/scripts/plan-artifact-gate.sh   scripts/plan-artifact-gate.sh
#   cp .claude/skills/planning-engineer/scripts/plan-weave-dispatch.sh  scripts/plan-weave-dispatch.sh
# plan-artifact-gate.sh fails closed on incomplete per-cycle artifacts / DONE drift; plan-weave-dispatch.sh
# fans the background Opus lanes out through weave (override PLAN_WEAVE_ORCH / the lane list per repo).

Done. Invoke as: /planning-engineer  (single cycle)  ·  /plan-loop  (continuous)
